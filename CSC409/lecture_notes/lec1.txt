latency
    measure of latency
        average latency is not a good measure
            because we do not know the distribution around the average
        maximum latency is not a good measure
            because the maximum latency may rarely happen (1% of the time)
        percentile (of one request) still no
            index.html takes many requests
                all users are in the last 1%

scalbility

vertical scaling
    better cpu
    better SSD
    better network
    ...
    not going to change software, not going to chage architecture, just scale the system up
horizontal scaling
    this course's main point
    add more computers, drives etc

speed:
c == c++ > *3 java > *10 python

use profiler to find out each funciton's time and space use

cache matters a lot in speed

if keep add hardware, performance actually decrease after initially improved a lot (a curve)
