Elastic Component Cloud

The most popular AWS Service
A way to use Infrastructure as a Service

Consist of:
    Renting virtual machine (EC2)
    Storing data on virutal device (EBS)
    Distributing load access machine (ELB)
    Scale the Service using auto scaling machine (ASG)
A lot of options/configuration

Security Groups
    fundation of network security in AWS
    control how traffic is allowed into or out of EC2 instances
    security groups only contain allow rules
    security group rules can reference by IP or by security group

Classic ports to know:
    22 - SSH
    21 - FTP
    22 - SFTP
    80 - HTTP
    3389 - RDP


EC2 Instances Purchasing Options:
    On-Demand Instance: short-workload, predictable pricing
    Reserved: (MINIMUM 1 year)
        Reserved Instances: long workloads
        Convertible Reserved Instances: long workloads with flexible instances
        Scheduled Reserved Instances: example - every Thursday between 3 and 6 pm
    Sport Instances: short workloads, cheap, can lose instances (less reliable)
    Dedicated Hosts: book an entire physical server, control instance implement
On-Demand Instances
    linux count per secont for billing, others count per hour
    highest cost, no upfront payment
    no long-term commietment
    RECOMMEND:
        short-term and uninterrupted workloads
        cannot predcit how the application will behave
Reserved Instances
    up to 75% discount in comparison to on demand
    reservation period: 1 year = + discount | 3 years = +++ discount
    Purchasing options: no upfront | partial upfront = + discount | Full upfront = ++ discount
    reserve a special instance type
    RECOMMEND:
        steady-state usage application
    Convertible Reserved Instance
        can change the EC2 instance type
        up to 54% discount
    Scheduled Reserved Instance
        lauch within the window you reserve
        when user require a fraction of day/ week/ month
        still commit over 1 to 3 years
Spot Instance
    90% discount
    price is float, it changes all the time
    if pay lesds than the current price, will loss the instance
    the most cost efficient instance in AWS
    RECOMMEND:
        useful for workloads that are resilient to failure
    NOT RECOMMEND:
        critical job or database
Dedicated Host
    RECOMMEND:
        compliance requirements
        can save money by using existing server-bound software service

Shared Responsibility Model for EC2
    AWS
        Infrastructure (Global network security)
        isolation on physical hosts
        replacing faulty hardware
        compliance validation
    User
        security groups rules
        operation-system patches and updates
        software and utilities installed on EC2 instance
        IAM roles assigned to EC2 & IAM user access management
        Data security on your instance
